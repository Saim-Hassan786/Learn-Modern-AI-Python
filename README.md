# üß† Modern AI Python

Welcome to **Modern AI Python**, a comprehensive and structured learning repository that covers foundational to advanced Python concepts with a theoretical lens. This course is curated for learners who aim to master Python as a modern tool for AI, data science, and software engineering.

> ‚öôÔ∏è Ideal for beginners and intermediate developers who want deep insight into both **classic Python theory** and **modern programming practices**.

- Control flow design patterns


### 06 - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

Learn how Python handles **collections**:

- List slicing, comprehensions, and performance
- Tuple immutability and use-cases
- Dictionary hashing and key rules
- Memory and speed considerations


### 07 - Sets

Understand the **mathematics of sets** in Python:

- Unique element storage
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference
- Performance characteristics
- Mutable vs immutable sets (`frozenset`)


### 08 - Modules and Functions

Explore **code modularization and reuse**:

- Defining and importing modules
- Built-in vs third-party modules
- Defining pure and impure functions
- Variable arguments: `*args`, `**kwargs`


### 09 - Exception Handling

Embrace Python's **error-handling philosophy**:

- `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`
- Custom exceptions and best practices
- Python‚Äôs EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)
- Raising and re-raising exceptions


### 10 - File Handling

Manage **persistent storage** and I/O:

- File modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`)
- Context managers (`with` statement)
- Reading/writing text and binary files
- Exception-safe file handling


### 11 - Math and Datetime

Leverage **mathematical and time-based utilities**:

- `math` module (rounding, trigonometry)
- `random` for simulations
- `datetime` and `timedelta` for scheduling
- Timestamps and formatting


### 12 - Traditional OOP Part 1

Understand **Object-Oriented Programming basics**:

- Classes and instances
- The `__init__` method and constructors
- Instance vs class variables
- `self` and method bindings


### 13 - Traditional OOP Part 2

Go deeper into **OOP abstractions**:

- Inheritance and method overriding
- `super()` usage and MRO
- Polymorphism and encapsulation
- Abstract base classes and interfaces


### 14 - Metaclasses and Dataclasses

Explore Python's **advanced object mechanics**:

- What are metaclasses and why they matter
- Customizing class creation
- `@dataclass` decorator: theory and benefits
- Comparison to traditional classes


### 15 - Pydantic and Generics

Modern data modeling with **type safety**:

- Introduction to Pydantic
- Data validation and parsing
- Type annotations and type checking
- Generics and reusable model templates


### 16 - Asyncio

Master **asynchronous programming** in Python:

- Event loops and concurrency theory
- `async` and `await` keywords
- Tasks, coroutines, and `asyncio.run()`
- Async I/O vs multithreading/multiprocessing


### 17 - CPython and GIL

Understand Python‚Äôs **execution model**:

- What is CPython?
- How the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** works
- Impacts on threading and performance
- Workarounds: multiprocessing, native extensions
